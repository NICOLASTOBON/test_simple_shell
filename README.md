## Description üìö

In this project, a simple UNIX command interpreter is developed using the C programming language. The following functions of a shell are discussed in the respective project:

* Interactive and non-interactive operation for the command entered in the form of an absolute path

* Input of commands in the form of absolute path, interpretation and execution

* Interpretation and execution of command flags entered in an absolute way

* Interactive and non-interactive operation for command entered without absolute path

* Input of command without absolute path, interpretation and execution

* Interpretation and execution of command flags entered in a non-absolute way

* Interpretation and execution of exit command

* Handling of the interruption signal by keyboard (ctrl + c)

* Interpretation and execution of the env command

* Interpretation and execution of the clear command

## Compilation üíª

Simple shell was compiled this way:

`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o JNS`

## Downloading üì•

You can download this repository like this:

`https://github.com/NICOLASTOBON/simple_shell.git`

## Non interactive

pass the commands in the stdin but no prints the prompt.

`$ echo "ls" | ./JNS`

## interactive

the program is execute and the prompt is print, and wait for the user.

`$ ./JNS`
`($)`
